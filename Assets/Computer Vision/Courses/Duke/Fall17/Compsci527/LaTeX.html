scientific domains to typeset documents. Most papers, proposals, theses, and books in these
disciplines are written in LaTeX. Knowing LaTeX is part and parcel of doing science.</p><p>Perhaps more importantly, <span style="font-style: italic">science is all about dissemination, and math is all
about clarity</span>.
A good scientific or technical idea is useful only if others know about it and understand it, so
you need to publish your ideas for them to have impact. Even within a company or a
work group, you need to
let others know and understand your thoughts. They won’t unless you explain them
clearly to them. The burden is on you to interest them and use their reading time wisely:
they have many other things to do. LaTeX lets you do this cleanly and elegantly, especially
for documents that are rich in mathematical content.</p><p>Clarity is not just for others, it is also for yourself. An idea is clear in your
head only once you write it down clearly. Only then can you scrutinize every piece of it
and make sure that you are not missing any link in your reasoning.</p><p>Writing things clearly
requires many iterations: jot down your idea roughly, then organize your thoughts in a
logical order, then simplify your reasoning, then streamline your text and notation.
Iterating by hand, with paper and pencil, would require too much rewriting. Using LaTeX,
on the other hand, lets you iterate by cutting, pasting, and editing, and the final
product is immediately usable as a finished document.</p><p>My graduate students, research collaborators, and I think and communicate in LaTeX. When
we write a paper for publication, we often iterate ten times or even more. The
paper keeps getting better, and so does our understanding of what we write. Try it
yourself, and you will soon discover that <span style="font-style: italic">LaTeX is not just a writing tool, it is a
thinking tool.</span></p><h3>2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Features_of_.La.Te.X)"></a>Features of LaTeX</h3><p>A word processor like Microsoft Word lets you to specify all the details of
what you want your document to look like. If you have a section title, for instance,
it is up to you to specify <span style="font-style: italic">how</span> that title is to be typeset: what typeface to
use, what size and style, whether to center the title or align it with the left margin,
and possibly more.</p><p></p><div class="SIntrapara">In contrast, LaTeX is a language that lets you specify <span style="font-style: italic">what</span> a specific part of
a document is. For instance, for a section title you write
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><blockquote class="SCentered"><p><span class="stt">\section{Features of LaTeX}</span></p></blockquote></div><div class="SIntrapara">This lets the LaTeX compiler know that it needs to start a new section, and that
the string <span class="stt">Features of LaTeX</span> is the section’s title. All the other decisions—numbering,
positioning,
typeface, and so forth—have been made in advance by people who are experts of typesetting.
As you write, you need not concern yourself with these details, and you can focus your
thinking on the substance of what you want to convey.</div><p></p><p>LaTeX is also highly customizable. For instance, it lets you redefine what the compiler
is supposed to do when it encounters a <span class="stt">\section</span> command. You can then wear a
typesetter’s hat and just think
about form: What typeface to use, where to place a section title, and so forth. When you
do this, you are oblivious of what a document is about, as you should be. In addition, if
you change your mind about format you can just redefine the commands, without touching your
document, and all your format changes show up consistently the next time you recompile it.</p><p>So LaTeX embodies an important distinction we will make in several other places in this
course: That between an <span style="font-style: italic">imperative</span> specification (<span style="font-style: italic">how</span> to do something) and a
<span style="font-style: italic">declarative</span> specification (<span style="font-style: italic">what</span> something is). A Microsoft Word file is by-and-large an
imperative specification of a document. A LaTeX file is a declarative specification.</p><h3>3<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Installing_.La.Te.X)"></a>Installing LaTeX</h3><p>You will write all homework for this course in LaTeX. For this you will need the
LaTeX software package and an editor you can use to write LaTeX files. These have
a <span class="stt">.tex</span> file extension. The package and the editor are separate pieces of software,
although some environments provide both.</p><p>There are two ways to get access to the necessary tools. One is to use
an online LaTeX editor and compiler called <span class="stt">ShareLaTeX</span>, the
other is to install LaTeX and an adequate file editor on your computer. Both these options
are available free of charge and are explained below.</p><p><span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">Pick your option and <span style="font-weight: bold">implement it now</span>. Do not wait until you absolutely need
to use LaTeX (such as the first homework assignment), as you will have to think
about other things then.</span></span></span> The choice between them is yours. It may take you an hour or so to install everything
on your computer (the LaTeX package is huge, more than 2GB), but you make a long-term
investment by doing so: You can now write papers
even when you have no Internet access, things happen faster, you have greater flexibility
about auxiliary files like pictures you want to incorporate in your documents, and you have
access to the guts of LaTeX if you want to see how it works.</p><p><span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">I haven’t heard of problems with <span class="stt">ShareLaTeX</span> availability, but <span style="font-weight: bold">we will
not accept lack of availability as an excuse for not handing in homework on time.</span></span></span></span>
If you are impatient, or you are up against a deadline (it is not recommended to be in this
situation), or you want to save disk space, the online version is the way to go. Remember, however, that
you are tying yourself to Internet availability and you need to assume that the <span class="stt">ShareLaTeX</span>
service is available when you need it as well.</p><h4>3.1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Share.La.Te.X)"></a><span class="stt">ShareLaTeX</span></h4><p>To use the online option, go to <a href="http://sharelatex.com/"><span class="url">http://sharelatex.com</span></a> in your favorite web browser. If this
is your first time on the site, you will be asked to register with an email and a password.
There is no charge for doing so, and there is no need to upgrade to the paid version.</p><p>Once you register, you will have access to a gallery of LaTeX sample files.
For homework, you will use the <span class="stt">.tex</span> templates we give you, and upload those to
<span class="stt">ShareLaTeX</span>. For now, however, pick one of the samples in the gallery to get a feel
for how the interface works. Open the file with the <span class="stt">Open in ShareLaTeX</span> button.</p><p>Once you have chosen a file and opened it, familiarize yourself with the <span class="stt">ShareLaTeX</span>
interface. At the very top left there is a menu icon that gives you some options. Initially,
you want to leave those alone. Some of them also require a paid subscription.</p><p>Next to the menu icon there is an angled arrow pointing up. This takes you to the list of
projects you are working on. Documents are
organized into <span style="font-style: italic">projects</span> in ShareLaTeX. You can think of a project as a
folder in which you have all the files that relate to a specific document. Every LaTeX
document has at least one <span class="stt">.tex</span> file, say, <span class="stt">hw1.tex</span> for your first assignment. Larger
documents are best organized into several <span class="stt">.tex</span> files, perhaps one per chapter or
section, with one master file, say <span class="stt">book.txt</span> that <span style="font-style: italic">includes</span> the others with
commands like <span class="stt">\include{chapter1}</span> (the <span class="stt">\include</span> command already knows to expect
a <span class="stt">.tex</span> extension, so you need not provide that in the command).</p><p>Follow the up arrow to
see the list of projects you are working on (for now this list may just have a single project).
After that, go back down to the project you chose by clicking on its title.</p><p>At the same level as the up arrow and the project title, but on the far right of the window,
you see three other icons. Please ignore these features of the paid subscription.</p><p></p><div class="SIntrapara">The rest of the window has three columns:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ul><li><p>The list of files in the project. Many of these files are
generated by the LaTeX compiler when you compile a document. Note in particular the
“upload” icon (third icon) at the top of this column. This will let you upload
your own <span class="stt">.tex</span> file.</p></li><li><p>An editor open on the main <span class="stt">.tex</span>
file of the project. The name of the file currently open in this column
is in red in the leftmost column of the window.</p></li><li><p>A view of the PDF file obtained by compiling the <span class="stt">.tex</span> file.</p></li></ul></div><p></p><p>Try to make a small change to the <span class="stt">.tex</span> file in the middle column. Change the
English text somewhere,
not what is inside commands, and do so after the command <span class="stt">\begin{document}</span>, which
always occurs in a document. Keep in mind that lines that start with a percent symbol are
comments, and those do not show up in the final PDF. Then click on the large <span class="stt">Recompile</span>
button at the top of the rightmost column, and verify that your change shows up in the document.</p><p>Make  also a bad change and then recompile, to see what happens. For instance, all LaTeX commands
start with a backslash character ‘<span class="stt">\</span>’. Add the string  <span class="stt">\bogus</span>, which is not a
recognized LaTeX command, somewhere in the English text after the command
<span class="stt">\begin{document}</span>. Depending on the nature of the error you introduce,
you will get some highlight information in the middle column, and LaTeX still limps
ahead after ignoring the command. If the error is fatal, no PDF is produced, and you get
some diagnostic information in the PDF column on the right. It takes some time to get used to this
information, which is sometimes overly verbose, sometimes not very informative.</p><p>Once you have corrected the mistake(s), save the PDF file to your disk by clicking on the
“download” icon (a down-arrow with a computer disk below it) next to the <span class="stt">Recompile</span> button.</p><p>You now know the basics of using <span class="stt">ShareLaTeX</span>.</p><h4>3.2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Installing_on_.O.S_.X)"></a>Installing on OS X</h4><p>On a Mac, go to <a href="http://tug.org/mactex/"><span class="url">http://tug.org/mactex/</span></a> and download the <span class="stt">MacTeX.pkg</span> installation package, then
double click on it to install. The software will show up in a <span class="stt">Tex</span> folder in the
<span class="stt">Applications</span> folder of your computer. Drag the application <span class="stt">TeXShop</span> from that folder
onto your taskbar, so you have easy access to it in the future. You could also use <span class="stt">TexWorks</span>
instead of <span class="stt">TeXShop</span> (in the same <span class="stt">Tex</span> folder) if you prefer a more minimalist interface. I recommend <span class="stt">TexShop</span>
for this class.</p><p>Open the <span class="stt">TeXShop</span> application. Depending on your settings, you may have to override your OS X
Security and Privacy preferences the first time by following
<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/PH18658">these instructions from Apple</a>.</p><p>A window shows up with a blank page. Make sure that the menu to the right of the <span class="stt">Typeset</span> button
at the top is set to <span class="stt">LaTeX</span>. To create an empty document, select <span class="stt">LatexTemplate</span> from
the <span class="stt">Templates</span> menu at the top of the window. If you now click on <span class="stt">Typeset</span>, you will
be asked to name and save the <span class="stt">.tex</span> file. After doing that, the LaTeX compiler generates
the <span class="stt">.pdf</span> file corresponding to that <span class="stt">.tex</span> file (same base name), and <span class="stt">TeXShop</span> displays the result, which
will look rather empty.</p><p>The renderer used to display the PDF file is <span class="stt">TeXShop</span>’s own. You can of course also open the
same file by navigating to it in the Finder and opening it with your favorite PDF viewer
(<span class="stt">Preview</span> by default if you double-click the file).</p><p>You have now made your first LaTeX document. Try to add some text and inject some errors, along
the lines of the last few paragraphs of the section on <span class="stt">ShareLaTeX</span> above, and see what error
messages you obtain.</p><h4>3.3<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Installing_on_.Windows)"></a>Installing on Windows</h4><p>On a Windows computer, go to <a href="http://miktex.org/download"><span class="url">http://miktex.org/download</span></a> and download the MiKTeX installer.
Find the installer in the folder you downloaded it to, and double-click on it to run it.</p><p>You will then need to separately install a text editor that understands LaTeX.
<a href="http://www.winedt.com/">WinEDT</a> is highly recommended. Click on the Download link
on the <a href="http://www.winedt.com/">WinEDT page</a> to download and follow the installation
instructions.</p><p>After installation, run WinEDT. The configuration wizard will run automatically. Click on
the <span class="stt">File Associations</span> tab and under <span class="stt">Current User</span> click on
<span class="stt">Modify file type associations...</span>. When you clik <span class="stt">OK</span>, all <span class="stt">.tex</span> files are
associated to WinEDT as the default application that opens them when you double-click.</p><p>To create a simple <span class="stt">.tex</span> file, paste or copy the following into the main WinEDT window:</p><p></p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="stt">\documentclass[12pt]{article}</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="stt"></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="stt">\title{My first {\LaTeX} Document}</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="stt">\author{My Name}</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="stt"></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="stt">\begin{document}</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="stt">\maketitle</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="stt"></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="stt">Hello, World!</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="stt"></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="stt">\end{document}</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p>Save the document as a file, say <span class="stt">first.tex</span>. There are various ways to turn this
document into a PDF file. The preferred way for this course is to use the <span class="stt">PDFLaTeX</span> command
you will find in WinEDT’s toolbar at the top right. WinEDT will call the default PDF viewer
to display this file. Alternatively, you can double-click on the <span class="stt">first.pdf</span> file from
Windows.</p><p>You have now made your first LaTeX document. Try to add some text and inject some errors, along
