This assignment is in two parts. First, write the routine PCA, which is called in pcatest.ch.
The main routine will create a simulated random set of input images; four images each of six pixels.
Then the PCA routine will be called. In this routine you should print out the eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
You should zero the eigenvectors for which the eignevalues are <= 0.0001 since they are irrelevant. 
Project the original data onto the eigenvectorrs, and return these projections. 
On the web site pcatest.ch has the required code, but the acutal PCA routine is left blank.

The second part of the assignment is to finish the read-eigenface.ch routine which is on the website.In it's current form 
it reads in ten images, and converts them into a matrix of imgvect[NUM_PIXELS][NUM_IMAGES].
Here NUM_PIXELS is 396, and NUM_IMAGES is 10. It displays each image, and you must hit any key in order
to move from image to image. 

The goal is to take the first image yucel5.jpg and compare this image to all the other nine images to see which one is the 
most simlar. First you must normalize each image so that as a vector it has a magnitude of one. 

Then do this comparison in three ways. 
The first way is corrleation using a dot product. The second is least squares difference, and the third is using the PCA routine.
In each case you should print out the image which is the closest match, in my implementation it was yucel1.jpg.
The result should be the same for all three methods.

The PCA routine you wrote in the first part of the assignment (pcatest.ch) should be used to compute the projections, which 
are the co-ordinates of these images in the eigenspace. To find the closest image using the PCA approach find the image which
has the closest projection vector to the first image yucel5.jpg.

I use the routines mean, covariance, eigensystem, transpose, norm, dot, printf in this code.
